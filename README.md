# Predicting Water Quality Using PyTorch

This project predicts the quality of water using machine learning techniques implemented in PyTorch. The dataset contains various chemical and physical features of water samples, and the goal is to classify whether the water is safe for consumption.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle Water Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability)
- **Features:**
  - pH
  - Hardness
  - Solids
  - Chloramines
  - Sulfate
  - Conductivity
  - Organic_carbon
  - Trihalomethanes
  - Turbidity
  - Potability (target: 0 = Not safe, 1 = Safe)

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and handling missing values
- Train-test split and normalization
- Neural network model using PyTorch
- Binary classification
- Accuracy evaluation on the test set

## ⚙️ Usage

You can run the notebook directly in a Jupyter environment:


## 🧠 Model Architecture

* Input Layer: 9 features
* Hidden Layers: 2 layers with ReLU activation
* Output Layer: 1 unit with Sigmoid activation
* Loss Function: Binary Cross Entropy Loss
* Optimizer: Adam

## 📈 Results

Achieves over **70% accuracy** on the test set. With further hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering, this can be improved.

## 📌 TODO

* [ ] Add more performance metrics (F1-score, ROC-AUC)
* [ ] Implement hyperparameter tuning
* [ ] Deploy the model with a simple web interface
